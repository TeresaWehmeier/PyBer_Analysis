# PyBer Ride-Sharing Analysis

## Overview
PyBer Ride-sharing has requested an analysis of their 2019 ride-sharing data. This analysis requires:
- A summary DataFrame that includes
  - total rides,
  - total drivers,
  - total fares,
  - average rides, fares and drivers by city types
- Graphs to visualize the data
- A report that provides recommendations to the CEO on how the data might assist in decision-making.

## Resources
The analysis is built using Python in Jupyter Notebook. Three data files are provided for the analysis, and are located in the <a href="https://https://github.com/TeresaWehmeier/PyBer_Analysis/tree/main/Resources/">Resources folder</a>. MATPLOTLIB module is used to develop the graphs.

## Results
PyBer Ride-Share serves 120 cities, 55% of which are urban, while 30% are suburban and the remaining 15% are rural cities. There are 2375 rides recorded between 1/1/2019 and 5/28/2019. As expected, urban cities deliver the most rides, 1625 according to the data, or 68% of all rides. Urban cities also employee the highest number of drivers with 2405 of the 2973 employed by PyBer working within urban areas. The scatterplot below shows the ride-share distribution based on city type and number of rides, with circle size correlating to driver number per city.
